# Build an Image Sharing App with MERN Stack

We'll learn how to create a full stack image sharing application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

## Learn how to:

- Use the functional components of React.
- Use the Axios library to connect React components to the Node.js server.
- Use MongoDB to store and retrieve data through the Mongoose library.
- Use Redux and React Hooks to develop the application.
- Connect the Node.js server to store and retrieve data from MongoDB.
- Use React state management Hooks to share data between functional components.

## Project Description

In this project, we'll build an image sharing app with the login and register functionalities.  
 The application will allow users to upload and share image posts from their accounts.  
 It will also allow users to follow and unfollow one another.

> We'll use the Express framework for Node.js to develop the backend API to interact with the MongoDB database to fetch and store data.  
> After setting up the backend, we'll implement the front-end components and add the login/register and image sharing functionalities.  
> The finalized product will fetch the data from MongoDB via the Node.js server and display it in the React functional components.

The components in the application are styled with pre-written CSS to provide the initial template of the application.
